# MSA
## [WIP]

This is a collection of generic MSA (_Multiple Sequence Alignment_) tools created for studying purposes, such as:

- Dynamic Programming: 'naiv' approach to MSA that generates an optimal solution
- Center Star Method [WIP]: approximation in polynomial time that calculates a solution that is at worst 2x the value of the optimal solution
- Progressive Alignment (CLUSTALW) [WIP]
